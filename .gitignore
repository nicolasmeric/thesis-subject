# Ignore biblatex datamodel files
# generated by main file to add new entry fields.
#
# The files have the extension dbx.
#
# Redefining the data model can be done in several places.
# Style authors can create a .dbx file which contains
# the data model macros required
# and this will be loaded automatically when using
# the biblatex package style option
# by looking for a file named after the style with a .dbx extension
# (just like the .cbx and .bbx files for a style).
# If the style option is not used but rather the citestyle and bibstyle options,
# then the package will try to load .dbx files
# called <citestyle>.dbx and <bibstyle>.dbx.
# Alternatively, the name of the data model file can be different
# from any of the style option names by specifying the name
# (without .dbx extension) to the package datamodel option.
# After loading the style data model file, biblatex then loads, if present,
# a users biblatex-dm.cfg which should be put somewhere biblatex can find it,
# just like the main configuration file biblatex.cfg.
# To summarise, the data model is determined by adding to the data model
# from each of these locations, in order:
# blx-dm.def→
#   <datamodel option>.dbx →
#     <style option>.dbx →
#       <citestyle option>.dbx and <bibstyle option>.dbx →
#         biblatex-dm.cfg
# See biblatex documentation file biblatex.pdf,

# There are packages, such as listings and ccaption,
# that provide new Listof lists.
# These can be handled by the tocbibind package
# in a similar manner to the usual Listofs.
# Two examples are given below.
# The listings package version 0.2 provides a \lstlistoflistings command
# to print a list of listings.
# The header name for this list is in \lstlistingname
# and the listing file has the extension lol.
# This can be treated just like the \listoffigure, etc., commands.
# To add the List of Listings header to the ToC do:
#   \renewcommand{\lstlistoflistings}{\begingroup
#   \tocfile{\lstlistingname}{lol}
#   \endgroup}
# See tocbibind documentation file tocbibind.pdf,
# v1.5k, 2010/10/13, section 2.3, page 5.
