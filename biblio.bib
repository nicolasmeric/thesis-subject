	abstract="Kind 2 is an open-source, multi-engine, SMT-based model checker for safety properties of finite- and infinite-state synchronous reactive systems. It takes as input models written in an extension of the Lustre language that allows the specification of assume-guarantee-style contracts for system components. Kind 2 was implemented from scratch based on techniques used by its predecessor, the PKind model checker. This paper discusses a number of improvements over PKind in terms of invariant generation. It also introduces two main features: contract-based compositional reasoning and certificate generation.",

  abstract	= {This book is a self-contained introduction to interactive
		  proof in higher-order logic (\acs{hol}), using the proof
		  assistant Isabelle2002. It is a tutorial for potential
		  users rather than a monograph for researchers. The book has
		  three parts.
		  
		  1. Elementary Techniques shows how to model functional
		  programs in higher-order logic. Early examples involve
		  lists and the natural numbers. Most proofs are two steps
		  long, consisting of induction on a chosen variable followed
		  by the auto tactic. But even this elementary part covers
		  such advanced topics as nested and mutual recursion. 2.
		  Logic and Sets presents a collection of lower-level tactics
		  that you can use to apply rules selectively. It also
		  describes Isabelle/\acs{hol}'s treatment of sets, functions
		  and relations and explains how to define sets inductively.
		  One of the examples concerns the theory of model checking,
		  and another is drawn from a classic textbook on formal
		  languages. 3. Advanced Material describes a variety of
		  other topics. Among these are the real numbers, records and
		  overloading. Advanced techniques are described involving
		  induction and recursion. A whole chapter is devoted to an
		  extended example: the verification of a security protocol. },

abstract="We describe two complementary techniques to aid the automatic verification of safety properties of synchronous systems by model checking. A first technique allows the automatic generation of certain inductive invariants for mode variables. Such invariants are crucial in the verification of safety properties in systems with complex modal behavior. A second technique allows the simultaneous verification of multiple properties incrementally. Specifically, the outcome of a property---valid or invalid---is communicated to the user as soon as it is known. Moreover, each property proven valid is used immediately as an invariant in the model checking procedure to aid the verification of the remaining properties. We have implemented these techniques as new options in the Kind model checker. Experimental evidence shows that these two techniques combine synergistically to increase Kind's precision as well as its speed.",
